<h1> Books open minds, giving the reader or audience something
to think about! This is due to the author writing
from a historical standpoint. It stems
from magnificent statements or historical figures
who have had statements of impact. </h1>

<h2> Intro to Love of Books </h2>

<p> There are many talented authors who can
project words of unimaginable strength onto
a page. Once someone reads their book, it turns
to an wonderful experience. I've had the pleasure
of reading one book called Stalin by the author
Stephen Kotkin.</p>

<br>
<p> Although a notorious figure in history, the author
has spun a web of words that got me caught into
reading his scholastic book. I still am trying to
read it during free time. There are other books
that have interested me with talented authors. And
it is in reading these books that inspires me
to wanna become a great writer. It is a monumental
achievement that they wrote these books and
I'm still trying to read the charismatic words
printed on the pages.</p>

<br>

<p> Like this book, there are plenty of books
that has wonderful stories trapped into the pages
for many to read. This is one of the reasons that many
become passionate about books. Why many visit
libraries and wait the next selection of great
books to be devoured by the eyes; like a feast by
a great chef. </p>

figure caption= This is the Duke Humfreys Library
with a spectacular interior design. Even the interior
decorating of the library or bookstores can
spark the interests of a lifetime for reading or
frequent return to the place of books.

<p> This passion for reading can happen at any
age. But the books are in the library waiting on
anyone to take on the mission to enjoy reading them.
It is like a James Bond or Jason Bourne film.
reading is a fun mission to be handled greatly.
Once the mission is completed, the books wait on
the next person to read them. It is such an adventure.
But it takes a talented writer to catch those words
onto the pages.</p>
